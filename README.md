# Welcome To ScriptEvent_Transpiler
Read the [WIKI](https://github.com/lumbermixalot/ScriptEvent_Transpiler/wiki) to learn how to use this tool to create ScriptEvent LUA assets for O3DE.

# For instructions to use the C++ version
Read [./CppApp/README.md](./CppApp/README.md).  


# For instructions to use the Python version
Read [./PythonApp/README.md](./Python/README.md).  
REMARK: This was the original version of this tool, but this tool uses
ANTLR4, which has proven to be very difficult to setup when used as a python
module. So it is recommended to use the C++ version for a more straightforward
experience.
